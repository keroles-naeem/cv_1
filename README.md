in gitlab

You asked about "in gitlab" in the context of our previous discussion on Terraform debug logging and provider development. Here’s a concise explanation of how Terraform debug logging and troubleshooting relates to GitLab, especially if you are running Terraform within GitLab CI/CD pipelines or using GitLab’s Terraform integration.

***

## Debugging Terraform in GitLab CI/CD

When running Terraform commands inside GitLab pipelines, you can enable debug logging like you do locally by setting environment variables:

- Set the following **in your `.gitlab-ci.yml`** file under the job that runs Terraform:

```yaml
variables:
  TF_LOG: DEBUG
  TF_LOG_PATH: terraform.log  # Optional: store logs in file inside the job workspace
```

This will activate detailed debug logs during your pipeline runs, which are printed to the job log or saved to a file if `TF_LOG_PATH` is set.

***

## Viewing Logs in GitLab

- The Terraform debug output will be part of the **job logs** you see in GitLab’s web UI.
- If you set `TF_LOG_PATH`, the log file will be created as an artifact or within the workspace which you can upload or inspect.

***

## Additional Debugging Tips for GitLab & Terraform Integration

- GitLab has a [Terraform integration](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/infrastructure/iac/terraform_state/) that manages state files. You can check their built-in troubleshooting guide for common issues.
- For **pipeline debugging** in general, GitLab’s docs on [Debugging CI/CD pipelines](https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/debugging/) may help.
- Be sure to also check permissions and tokens if your Terraform provider interacts with API endpoints (like your custom provider).

***

## Summary for Terraform Debug Logging in GitLab

- Use environment variables in GitLab CI jobs:

```yaml
variables:
  TF_LOG: DEBUG
  TF_LOG_PATH: /path/to/terraform-debug.log
```

- Logs appear in GitLab job output or files.
- Use `TRACE` instead of `DEBUG` for more verbose logs.
- Combine with printed debug info inside your custom Terraform provider (e.g., `fmt.Println` or `tflog`).

export tf_log="debug"

Ah — I see what you’re trying to do.  
You want to **enable Terraform’s debug logging** so you can see what’s happening inside the provider (including the variables you print) when you run Terraform.  

***

## **How to enable `TF_LOG`**

In your terminal, before running `terraform plan` or `terraform apply`, set the `TF_LOG` environment variable, like:

### **Linux / macOS (bash/zsh)**
```bash
export TF_LOG=DEBUG
```
(You can also use `TRACE` for even more details.)

Then run:
```bash
terraform apply
```

### **Windows PowerShell**
```powershell
$env:TF_LOG="DEBUG"
terraform apply
```

***

## **Optional — save logs to a file**
To avoid flooding your terminal:

```bash
export TF_LOG=DEBUG
export TF_LOG_PATH=./terraform.log
terraform apply
```
Now all logs go into `terraform.log` in the current directory.

***

## **In your provider**
Since we added `fmt.Println()` and `json.MarshalIndent()` calls in `Create/Update`, they’ll also appear in the same log output.

**Pro tip:** Terraform sends your provider’s stdout/stderr into its own log. So with `TF_LOG=DEBUG` enabled, you will see both:
- Terraform core debug messages
- Your provider’s print statements

***

If you want, I can show you how to make your **Go provider respect `TF_LOG`** and use the built‑in `tflog.Debug()` instead of raw `fmt.Println()` so your debug messages integrate neatly with Terraform’s logging system.  

Do you want me to give you that logging upgrade?
json imported and not used even i use it?

The error "json imported and not used" in Go occurs when you import the `encoding/json` package but do not actually use it anywhere in your code. Go requires that all imported packages be used; otherwise, it raises a compile-time error.

Here is how you can fix or handle this:

1. **Make sure you use the `json` package where needed:**
   - For example, if you want to print the API request as JSON for debugging:
     ```go
     import (
       "encoding/json"
       "fmt"
       // other imports
     )
     
     // somewhere in your code, before sending API request:
     b, err := json.MarshalIndent(apiReq, "", "  ")
     if err != nil {
         fmt.Println("Error marshalling API request:", err)
     } else {
         fmt.Println("DEBUG API request JSON:\n", string(b))
     }
     ```

2. **If you have the import but don't need to use JSON yet:**
   - You can remove the import to satisfy the compiler.
   - Or, if you want to keep the import for later but avoid errors, you can temporarily do:
     ```go
     import _ "encoding/json"
     ```
     but this is not recommended for `json` as an unused side effect import.

3. **Check if you have commented out or missed the usage of `json` in your debug prints.**
   
4. **In Terraform provider development, you often use JSON marshalling to pretty-print structs or request bodies for debugging, so using `json.MarshalIndent` as shown above is common.**





i want to print all variable send to api

Gotcha — you now want to **print every variable you are sending to the API** so you can debug the exact payload being sent from your Terraform provider.

Because you’re working with the Terraform Plugin Framework, you usually have a **plan** or **state** struct (e.g. `MyResourceModel`) that you pass through your conversion functions before calling your API client.

***

## 1️⃣ Simple case — your API request struct
If you’ve already built your API request struct, you can just `fmt.Printf` it:

```go
fmt.Printf("DEBUG API request payload: %+v\n", apiReq)
```

The `%+v` verb shows **field names and values**.

If you want **JSON** so it looks exactly like what you’d send over the wire:

```go
b, _ := json.MarshalIndent(apiReq, "", "  ")
fmt.Println("DEBUG API request JSON:")
fmt.Println(string(b))
```

***

## 2️⃣ Extracting variables from `plan` (Terraform model)
If you want *all* variables a user set in Terraform before converting to API, just debug‑print the `plan` struct:

```go
fmt.Printf("DEBUG Terraform plan: %+v\n", plan)
```

The catch: `types.Map`, `types.String`, `types.Int64`, etc. don’t pretty‑print as their raw values — you’ll get `Value = {...}`.

So for each `types.Map`, you must extract to a Go type:

```go
if !plan.AdditionalParam.IsNull() {
    var addParams map[string]string
    diags := plan.AdditionalParam.ElementsAs(ctx, &addParams, false)
    if diags.HasError() {
        fmt.Println("Error converting AdditionalParam:", diags)
    }
    fmt.Println("DEBUG AdditionalParam:", addParams)
}
```

***

## 3️⃣ Put it all together — debug in Create/Update before API call

```go
func (r *MyResource) Create(ctx context.Context, req resource.CreateRequest, resp *resource.CreateResponse) {
    var plan MyResourceModel
    diags := req.Plan.Get(ctx, &plan)
    resp.Diagnostics.Append(diags...)
    if resp.Diagnostics.HasError() {
        return
    }

    // Extract AdditionalParam map for printing
    var addParams map[string]string
    if !plan.AdditionalParam.IsNull() {
        diags := plan.AdditionalParam.ElementsAs(ctx, &addParams, false)
        resp.Diagnostics.Append(diags...)
    }

    fmt.Println("DEBUG: AdditionalParam to send to API:", addParams)

    // Convert whole plan to API model
    apiMap, _ := convertAdditionalParamToAPI(ctx, plan.AdditionalParam)
    apiReq := ApiModel{
        AdditionalParam: apiMap,
        // other fields...
    }

    // Print full API request as JSON
    b, _ := json.MarshalIndent(apiReq, "", "  ")
    fmt.Println("DEBUG: Full API request JSON:\n", string(b))

    // Call API
    apiResp, err := r.client.CreateResource(apiReq)
    if err != nil {
        resp.Diagnostics.AddError("API Error", err.Error())
        return
    }

    plan.AdditionalParam = convertAdditionalParamToTFSdk(ctx, apiResp.AdditionalParam)

    resp.State.Set(ctx, &plan)
}
```

***

## ✅ Key points

- **Before** calling your API client, log the struct (or JSON) so you see exactly what’s being sent.
- Use `%+v` for field names or `json.MarshalIndent` for pretty JSON.
- For `types.Map` in Terraform Plugin Framework, use `.ElementsAs()` to get a regular Go map for logging/debugging.
- This works the same way in `Create`, `Update`, or even `Delete` if you want to debug deletions.

***

If you want, I can write you a **drop‑in debug utility** that takes *any* `types.Object`/`types.Map` Terraform model and prints all fields recursively as a clean JSON before API calls — that way you always see the exact payload.  

Do you want me to prepare that?
