Your test is failing because the version sorting (in `cleanUpLowerVersion`) relies on numeric comparison via `strconv.Atoi`, but your version strings use underscores (`0_0_10`, `0_0_2`, etc.), and the test’s logic for expected results assumes a certain sorted order. This is causing both the wrong version to be left after cleanup and, eventually, an index out of range panic when you assert at e.g., `versions[1]` after deletion has shrunk the slice.

## Why you got this failure

- When sorting, `"0_0_10"` ends up **before** `"0_0_2"` if the comparison is lexicographical or if parsing fails (because `strconv.Atoi("0_0_10")` fails, so it falls back to a string comparison, which gives the wrong order for version semantics).
- Your assertion expects `"0_0_10"` to be the "first version", but the actual first is `"0_0_2"` due to faulty sorting.
- The panic (`index out of range`) occurs because after cleanup, the slice doesn’t have enough elements, but you access `versions[1]` anyway.

## The core issue:  
**Sorting does not handle underscore-separated or semver strings correctly.**

***

## How to fix:

### 1. Parse your version string into its numeric components and compare each part.
Here’s a Go function for safe, semantic (major, minor, patch) comparison:

```go
func semverLess(a, b string) bool {
    parse := func(v string) (int, int, int) {
        parts := strings.Split(v, "_")
        get := func(i int) int {
            if i < len(parts) {
                n, err := strconv.Atoi(parts[i])
                if err == nil {
                    return n
                }
            }
            return 0
        }
        return get(0), get(1), get(2)
    }
    a1, a2, a3 := parse(a)
    b1, b2, b3 := parse(b)
    if a1 != b1 {
        return a1 < b1
    }
    if a2 != b2 {
        return a2 < b2
    }
    return a3 < b3
}
```
Now, change your sort code to:
```go
sort.Slice(*versionContainers, func(i, j int) bool {
    return semverLess((*versionContainers)[i].Version, (*versionContainers)[j].Version)
})
```

### 2. Make sure your test AND code always use the same version format (preferably dots: `0.0.10`, but underscores can work with this comparison).

### 3. In your test, always check slice lengths before accessing indexes, or adjust the assertions for the number of MAX_VERSIONS.

***

## In summary:
- You need semantic version sorting—lexical or direct integer parsing will not work for strings like `0_0_10`.
- The panic is due to reading indexes from a slice that’s already been truncated by cleanup.

***

**Fix your version sort function, and your test and code will behave as expected, preserving the highest versions and producing the correct order for your cleanup and assertions.**

Here’s how to update your code to use semantic version-aware sorting for underscore-separated version strings. This will fix your order, test, and the “index out of range” issue.

***

## 1. Add a semantic version comparison function

Place this function somewhere near your sorting logic:

```go
import (
    "strconv"
    "strings"
)

func semverUnderscoreLess(a, b string) bool {
    parse := func(v string) (int, int, int) {
        parts := strings.Split(v, "_")
        get := func(i int) int {
            if i < len(parts) {
                n, err := strconv.Atoi(parts[i])
                if err == nil {
                    return n
                }
            }
            return 0
        }
        return get(0), get(1), get(2)
    }
    a1, a2, a3 := parse(a)
    b1, b2, b3 := parse(b)
    if a1 != b1 {
        return a1 < b1
    }
    if a2 != b2 {
        return a2 < b2
    }
    return a3 < b3
}
```

***

## 2. Update your sort call in `cleanUpLowerVersion`

Replace this block in `cleanUpLowerVersion`:

```go
sort.Slice(*versionContainers, func(i, j int) bool {
    vi, errI := strconv.Atoi((*versionContainers)[i].Version)
    vj, errJ := strconv.Atoi((*versionContainers)[j].Version)
    if errI != nil || errJ != nil {
        return (*versionContainers)[i].Version < (*versionContainers)[j].Version
    }
    return vi < vj
})
```
**With:**
```go
sort.Slice(*versionContainers, func(i, j int) bool {
    return semverUnderscoreLess((*versionContainers)[i].Version, (*versionContainers)[j].Version)
})
```

***

## 3. Re-run your test

Now, the sorting will treat `"0_0_10"` as greater than `"0_0_2"`, ensuring your tests and version cleanup logic behave correctly.

***

**That’s it! Your implementation now handles semantic (even underscore-separated) versions as expected.**
