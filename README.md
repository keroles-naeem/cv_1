The error message during `tofu init` indicates that Terraform/OpenTofu is requesting version `v3924.0.0`:

```
Provider tfp.entw.oase.itz.itzbund.net/nearcloud/oase v3924.0.0 does not have a package available for your current platform, linux_amd64.
```

However, your pipeline and Makefile produce versions like `0_0_3924` (underscore separated), *without* the `v` prefix and *with underscores*, e.g.,

```
terraform-provider-oase_0_0_3924_linux_amd64.zip
```

***

## Problem Analysis

- Your provider version as recorded and served by your registry is **`0_0_3924`** (underscore format), but OpenTofu/Terraform request **`3924.0.0`** (dot-separated semantic version).
- This creates a mismatch causing Terraform/OpenTofu to **not find a matching ZIP package** for that version and platform.
- The Terraform/OpenTofu CLI expects standard semver style versions like `X.Y.Z` (dots), *not* underscore-separated versions like `0_0_3924`.
- Your CI and Makefile produce artifacts and upload metadata based on the underscore version, but the client requests the dot version (with a `v` sometimes).

***

## How to fix it

### Option 1: Align your version format with Terraform expectations (recommended)

- Change your CI and Makefile to use **dot-separated semantic version strings**, e.g.:

```yaml
variables:
  VERSION_PIP_ID: "${CI_PIPELINE_ID}.0.0"
  VERSION: "${VERSION_PIP_ID}"
```

- Then build and upload files named:

```
terraform-provider-oase_3924.0.0_linux_amd64.zip
```

- This will match what Terraform/OpenTofu requests (note the exact version string with dots).

***

### Option 2: Map or alias versions in your registry (advanced)

- Keep uploading files with underscore versions, but **add registry metadata** or translation layer to map incoming client version requests like `3924.0.0` to your stored files named `0_0_3924`.
- This requires custom code in your registry server or proxy to remap versions and rewrite URLs.
- Consider renaming your artifacts on upload to dot-semver style for maximum compatibility.

***

### Option 3: Modify provider version references in your Terraform/OpenTofu config (not typical)

- If possible, force Terraform/OpenTofu to request provider versions with underscores, e.g., `0_0_3924`, but this is not standard and likely wonâ€™t work out of the box.

## What to do next?

1. **Change GitLab CI variables to:**

```yaml
variables:
  VERSION_PIP_ID: "${CI_PIPELINE_ID}.0.0"
  VERSION: "${VERSION_PIP_ID}"
```

2. **Update your Makefile VERSION default to:**

```makefile
VERSION ?= 0.0.0
```

and override with `make release VERSION=3924.0.0` from CI.

3. This will produce artifacts named with dots:

```
terraform-provider-oase_3924.0.0_linux_amd64.zip
```

which Terraform/OpenTofu will correctly find on init.

If you want, I can generate an updated `.gitlab-ci.yml` and Makefile with these changes applied to fix your version mismatch. This is the cleanest and most supported approach. Would you like me to do that?
